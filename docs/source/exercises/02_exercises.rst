Task 2.1
^^^^^^^^^^^

Create your repository based on
`repository template <https://github.com/natenka/pyneng-examples-exercises/>`__
with tasks and examples. To do this, press "Use this template".

Created repository will be a copy of pyneng-examples-exercises repository,
but is not tied to it. It's better to perform tasks in prepared files in
exercises directory as tests for tasks depend on created directory structure.
