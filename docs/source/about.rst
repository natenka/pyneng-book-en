About book
-------

In nutshell, this book is like CCNA but for python. From the one hand, book is basic enough so everyone can handle it, from the other hand, book covers all main topics which allow you to develop skill independently in the future. Python deep dive is not a goal of this book. The goal is to explain Python basics in plain language and provide understanding of necessary tools for practical usage. Everything in this book is focused on network equipment and interaction with it. It right away gives opportunity to use knowledge gained at the course in network engineers daily work. All shown examples are based on Cisco equipment but, of course, they could be applied to any other equipment.

Who is this book for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For network engineers with or without programming experience. All examples and homework will be formed with a focus on network equipment. This book will be useful for network engineers who want to automate their daily basis routine tasks and want start coding but don't know how to approach this.
Still haven't decided whether it worth reading this book? Read :ref:`feedbacks <testimonials>`.

Why you need to learn programming?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Programming knowledge for network engineer could be compared with necessity of English knowledge. When you know English at least on level which allows to read technical documentation you expand your opportunities at once:

-  Much more literature, forums, blogs are available;
-  Easier to find solution for almost every question or issue if you ask Google.

Knowledge of programming is very similar in this. For instance, If you know Python at least on basic level  you open plenty of new opportunities. Also analogy to English fits here because you can be capable specialist without knowledge of English language. English gives you opportunity but it's not a mandatory requirement.


OS and Python requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All examples and terminal outputs in the book are shown on Debian Linux. Python 3.7 is used in this book but for the majority of examples Python 3.x will be enough. Only some examples requires Python version higher than 3.5. It always explicitly indicated and generally concerns some additional features.

Examples
~~~~~~~

All examples from the book resides in 
`repository <https://github.com/natenka/pyneng-examples-exercises>`__.
All examples have educational purpose. It means they not necessarily show the best solution since they are based on information which was covered in previous chapters. Moreover, often enough the examples in chapters are developing in tasks. In other words, in tasks you have to create better, more universal and, in general, more proper version of code. It's better to write code from the book on your own or at least download examples and try to modify them. So the information will be better remembered. If you don't have this possibility, for example when you read book on road, it's better to repeat examples later on your own. In any case, it's necessary to do tasks manually.

Tasks
~~~~~~~

All tasks and auxiliary files can be downloaded from the same
`repository  <https://github.com/natenka/pyneng-examples-exercises>`__,
where code examples are located. If task name consist of letter (for ex. 5.2a) it's better to complete this task after tasks without letters. Usually, tasks with letter are more complex and they continue the idea of task without letter. If possible it's better to do tasks one by one. There are no answers in the book because, unfortunately, when answers are present there is a great temptation to look at them instead of solving complex task on your own. Of course, sometimes it's difficult to find a solution - try to set this task aside, ask question in `Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/pyneng/shared_invite/enQtNzkyNTYwOTU5Njk5LWE4OGNjMmM1ZTlkNWQ0N2RhODExZDA0OTNhNDJjZDZlOTZhOGRiMzIyZjBhZWYzYzc3MTg3ZmQzODllYmQ4OWU>`__ and do another task.

.. note::
    Answers to almost all questions can be found in `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com>`__. So, if you see this website in Google search results it means with high probability the answer is found. Of course, it's better to ask Google in English - there are a lot of materials on Python and in general, it's easy to find a tip.

Answers can show how to solve task in another way or how to solve it in better way. But no need to worry about it because in the next chapters you will likely meet an example with proper code.

Quiz
~~~~~~~

Some chapters have additional questions:

-  `Data types. Part 1 <https://goo.gl/forms/xKHX5xNM8Pv5sQDf2>`__
-  `Data types. Part 2 <https://goo.gl/forms/igxR3ub3tQg3ycX53>`__
-  `Compound statements. Part 1 <https://goo.gl/forms/2TmGcrhG11h2SdLn1>`__
-  `Compound statements. Part 2 <https://goo.gl/forms/KZGaDquGlUmOz2kG3>`__
-  `Functions and modules. Part 1 <https://goo.gl/forms/M1DpbdD0brVbdp1G3>`__
-  `Functions and modules. Part 2 <https://goo.gl/forms/rNvdX9bHw8wLajJp2>`__
-  `Regular expressions. Part 1 <https://goo.gl/forms/5UpkJbm1dORqs4bP2>`__
-  `Regular expressions. Part 2 <https://goo.gl/forms/ltuOAO62yLlZkEmm1>`__
-  `Data bases <https://goo.gl/forms/wtGgmWg0vow1Cyqo1>`__

These quiz can be considered an evaluation test or as a task. It's useful to answer to these questions after reading of corresponding chapter. They will help you recall chapter's material and also see different aspects of Python usage in practice. First, try answer on your own and only then check answers in IPython on questions which you are doubting.

Presentations
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are presentations for each book chapter in
`repository <https://github.com/natenka/pyneng-slides>`__. It's convenient way to repeat and go through the information. If you know basics of Python it worth getting through it.

All presentations can be downloaded from special
`repository <https://github.com/natenka/pyneng-slides/tree/py3-pdf>`__.

Book formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Book is available in PDF and Epub formats. Both of them are being updated automatically, therefore the content is equal.


Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~

Discussions of book, tasks and other related topics are taken place in
`Slack <https://pyneng-slack.herokuapp.com>`__. Also write to 
`Slack <https://pyneng-slack.herokuapp.com>`__ in case of questions, suggestions, comments and observations on book.
