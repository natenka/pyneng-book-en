Tasks checking with tests
=================================

Starting with section "9. Functions" automatic tests are used to check tasks.
They help to check that everything conforms to the task and also provide
feedback on what is not up to task. Usually, after the first period of
adaptation it becomes easier to do tasks with tests.

In addition to above-mentioned positive features, tests can also show what
result is expected: clarify structure of data and details that may affect the result.

Pytest is used to run tests - a framework for writing tests.
