4. Python data types
============================

Python has several data types:

-  Numbers
-  Strings
-  Lists
-  Dictionaries
-  Tuples
-  Sets
-  Boolean

These data types, in turn, can be classified by several criteria:

-  mutable (lists, dictionaries and sets)
-  immutable (integers, strings and tuples)
-  ordered (lists, tuples, strings and dictionaries)
-  unordered (sets)
