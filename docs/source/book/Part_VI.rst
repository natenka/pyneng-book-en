VI.  Basics of object-oriented programming
#######################################################

Object-oriented programming (OOP) - a programming methodology in which a program
consists of objects that interact with each other. Objects are created on basis
of class defined in code and typically combine data and actions that can be
performed with data into a single whole.

It is possible to write code without using OOP, but at a minimum learning of OOP
basics will help to better understand what an object, class, method, variable are.
These are things that are used in Python all the time. In addition, knowledge of
OOP will be useful in reading someone else's code. For example, it will be easier
to understand netmiko code.
