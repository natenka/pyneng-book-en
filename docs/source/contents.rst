Python for network engineers
============================

The book covers Python basics  with examples and tasks built around networking topics.

On the one hand, this book is basic enough to be mastered by anyone, and on
the other hand,  covers all the main topics that will allow you to further
grow on your own. This book is not intended to be an in-depth look at Python. 
The purpose of this book is to explain the basics of Python in clear language
and provide an understanding of the necessary tools for practical use.
Everything in the book is focused on network equipment and interaction with it. 
This immediately makes it possible to use the knowledge gained in the daily
work of network engineers. All examples are shown using Cisco equipment
as an example, but of course they apply to any other equipment.

.. note::

    This book covers Python 3.7.
